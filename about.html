						Speccy has existed since approximately 2017,<br>
						but wasn't really developed until mid-2020<br>
						during the COVID-19 pandemic.<br><br>

						Since then she's gone through various changes,<br>
						from being a simple Tails recolor, to eventually<br>
						becoming a three-tailed Kitsune with glasses.<br><br>

						She has (had, she's still in debt) a home in<br>
						Jade Coast Zone. One of the many places you<br>
						can find on the Jade Isles.<br><br>

						Being a Kitsune however isn't all that much.<br>
						For Speccy, it means she has a bunch of tails<br>
						to worry about!! At least she can use them<br>
						to her advantage, or for fun... like sending<br>
						Crawlas, (natural to the Jade Isles) into<br>
						orbit!! Hehehe...<img src="graphics/emojis/woke.gif" /><br><br>

						Did you know she's friends with Eggman?<br>
						Not so many people know that, but it's true!<br><br>

						(see that machine in the background? more on that later)<br><br>
				
						It was shortly after the events of SRB2,<br>
						Speccy approached the now fallen madman and<br>
						helped him out since she wasn't going to just<br>
						let him suffer!<br><br>

						Speccy believes that there's kindness in<br>
						everyone out there. Even those who're clearly<br> 
						in the wrong.<br><br>

						Anyways, this would eventually go away for<br>
						a bit in SpA2 but that's another story.<br><br>

						Now about that machine, that's the "Doodlerizer."<br>
						It's one of the Speccy universe-exclusive machines.<br>
						More info on it next website update. - Marilyn <br>
